    content: |-
      I am currently an AI Dataset Engineer at [Reality Defender](https://realitydefender.ai). I help construct and maintain infrastructure and datasets that assist in the detection of deepfaked audio. I work extensively with cloud-based technologies to collect, clean, organize, and distribute audio data to our deepfake detection models.

      Before working in tech, I was studying to become a cognitive neuroscientist. I hold a Master's degree in computational social science from the University of Chicago, as well as a bachelor's degree in psychology and computer science from Oberlin College. My [research](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add2981) employed large datasets and machine learning techniques to probe why certain images are more memorable than others.

      I am also a musician (electric bass) and audio engineer. I built a project recording studio and have engineered several tracks with a variety of artists, from jazz fusion to country.
